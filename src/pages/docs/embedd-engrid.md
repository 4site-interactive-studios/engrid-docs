### Embedding one EN page in another 

Should you want to embed one Engaging Networks page in another (e.g. Embedded donation page on donation thank you page) simply add a code block with your desired URL; just **be sure to include ?chain** at the end.

```javascript
<iframe loading='lazy' width='100%' scrolling='no' class='engrid-iframe' src='https://lorem.ipsum.org/page/123456/donate/1?chain' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
```
