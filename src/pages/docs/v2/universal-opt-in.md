The Universal Opt-In component provides a consistent email opt-in experience across different Engaging Networks page types.

## How It Works

ENgrid's Universal Opt-In ensures that the email opt-in checkbox or question is handled consistently regardless of the page type (donation, petition, email-to-target, etc.). It normalizes the opt-in behavior so that the same opt-in logic applies across all form types.

## Configuration

Universal Opt-In is configured in your ENgrid theme options and can be customized per-page via `EngridPageOptions`.
