Utility class that makes a form component collapsed with clicked to expanded

```
Click-to-expand
```

You can add a second class to the same component (e.g., `click-to-expand click-to-expand-mobile` ), and this will cause this section to only appear as a "click-to-expand" on mobile. When viewed on desktop, the entire contents of the area will remain visible ( [recording](https://cln.sh/rsb696qg) ).

Usable on thank you pages.
