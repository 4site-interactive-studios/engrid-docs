## Setting up a local environment

#### Prerequisites:

- Your ENgrid template code. You can find this on your Github repository.
  - If you're starting a fresh project, use this [template repo](https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid/) to get started.
- Node.js (latest LTS) [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- An IDE or text editor, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), with support for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
  - If you're using VSCode you can support Prettier with [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- A method of locally serving your ENgrid assets from [https://your-repo-name.test](https://engrid-org_name.test)
  - At 4Site we use [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet) as a minimal development environment (macOS only)
  - For other operating systems:
    - Linux: Use the [Linux fork of Laravel Valet](https://cpriego.github.io/valet-linux/)
    - Windows: Use Laravel Valet via [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) or try [Laragon](https://laragon.org/)
    - Alternatively, manually configure a local web server with HTTPS support

#### Getting Started:

1. Clone your repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid-your-org.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

3. Start development with automatic compilation:
```shell
npm run start
```

4. When ready for production:
```shell
npm run build
```

## Upgrading the core ENgrid Scripts Package

Your ENgrid theme gets the vast majority of its functionality from the engrid package, which is used by your theme code.

That code is hosted on [Github here](https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid) and in 2 NPM packages [here](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/@4site/engrid-scripts) and [here](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/@4site/engrid-styles).

To bring in new features, you can run this command to upgrade the engrid-script package to the latest version and rebuild your assets:

```shell
npm run rebuild
```

If you need to use a specific engrid version you can run:

```shell
npm uninstall @4site/engrid-styles @4site/engrid-scripts
npm install @4site/engrid-styles@your-version-number
npm install @4site/engrid-scripts@your-version-number
```

You can always view your current ENgrid version in the banner at the start of your compiled JS and CSS assets.

## Making changes to the SCSS or JS files

For SCSS you'll find the majority of your code in the `/src/sass/page-template-styles.scss` file.

The majority of styles can be customized via CSS custom properties.

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
These properties are named with the convention:
\
`{component__name}-{property_name}_{modifier}`

{% /callout %}

For JS your theme will contain a `/src/scripts/main.js` file. Here you can add any extra JavaScript customizations you might need. `/src/index.ts` is the entry point for loading the ENgrid application. You can modify the Options here to customize the ENgrid components loaded and their functionality.

Refer to the [engrid](https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid) source for more information.

### Previewing your changes

When working locally you can use several URL parameters to help with development and testing:

* **?assets=local** - Loads your local assets from `https://your-repo-name.test`
  * This loads unminified assets and automatically enables debugging
  * Add `&debug=false` to use local assets without debug elements
* **?assets=your-branch-name** - Loads assets from a specific Github branch
* **?assets=flush** - Adds cache-busting timestamp to force-reload EN hosted assets
* **?assets=main** - Loads assets from the main branch of the GitHub repository

For debugging purposes:
* **?debug=true** - Enables debug mode with visual indicators and console logging
* **?debug=log** - Enables debug mode with console logging only

You can also add this code block to the page to set the asset source without URL parameters. Just make sure to add it to every sub-page (e.g., Thank You page) as well.:

```javascript
<script>window.EngridLoader = { assets: 'branch-name'};</script>
```

This is especially useful when:
- Moving between multiple pages
- Sharing links for public testing
- Avoiding the need to maintain URL parameters

## Building and deploying production files

Once you're happy with everything, you can compile the final assets with

```shell
npm run build
```

Then, upload the engrid.min.css and `engrid.min.js` files from your `/dist` folder to Engaging Networks, overwriting the existing assets.

{% callout title="You should know!" %}
Before doing this you should thoroughly test your changes using a Github branch, especially if you're upgrading engrid versions.
{% /callout %}

It may take some time for Engaging Network to refresh its cached assets. Until then, you can preview the changes by using the `?assets=flush URL parameter`, which will apply cache-busting to the assets.

## Advanced Development Techniques with ENgrid for Engaging Networks

- `?assets=local` - Loads the uncompressed ENgrid CSS and JS from

```
https://engrid-wwf.test/dist/engrid.[file-extension]
```

- `?assets=[branch-name]` - Loads the uncompressed ENgrid CSS and JS from the Client Repo's feature branch

```
https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid-[client-name]/[branch-name]
```

- `?engridcss=false` - Unloads the ENgrid CSS and applies minimal base styles to maintain a column layout. Useful for isolating CSS-related issues.
- `?engridjs=false` - Unloads the ENgrid JavaScript. Helpful for debugging JavaScript-related problems.

{% callout title="Debugging Tip!" %}
You can combine these parameters to completely disable ENgrid when troubleshooting with EN support:
- Use `?engridcss=false&engridjs=false` to disable both CSS and JS
- This makes it easier to demonstrate that an issue exists in the base EN form, independent of ENgrid customizations

## Global Variables

### EngridAmounts

With that variable you can set dynamic amounts at the page level.

Example:

```
window.EngridAmounts = {
  "onetime": {
    amounts: {
      "10": 10,
      "30": 30,
      "50": 50,
      "100": 100,
      "Other": "other",
    },
    default: 30,
  },
  "monthly": {
    amounts: {
      "5": 5,
      "15": 15,
      "25": 25,
      "30": 30,
      "Other": "other",
    },
    default: 15,
  },
};
```

When you're using the `window.EngridAmounts` option, the user-selected amount will persist when changing frequencies if:

1. We're coming from a backend error.
2. We have an amount defined via URL.
3. The user selected a non-default amount.

**Known Limitations**

1. This option does not work with NSG or other similar native EN features
2. You need to remove any Swap List from the donation amount field. If you don't there will be race conditions between the swap list and our code which will create unpredictable and inconsistent behaviors.
