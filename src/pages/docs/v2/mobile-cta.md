---

The Mobile CTA (Call to Action) component adds a sticky call-to-action button on mobile devices that scrolls the user to the donation form when tapped.

## How It Works

On mobile viewports, ENgrid can display a fixed/sticky button at the bottom of the screen that, when tapped, smoothly scrolls the user down to the donation form area. This is useful for long-form pages where the donation form may be below the fold.

## Styling

The mobile CTA is styled via `_engrid-mobile-cta.scss`. You can customize the button appearance, position, and breakpoint in your client theme.
