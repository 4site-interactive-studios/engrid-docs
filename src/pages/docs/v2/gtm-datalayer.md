title: Google Tag Manager (GTM DataLayer Setup)
description: Maximize your Engaging Networks platform's tracking capabilities by integrating Google Tag Manager and DataLayer with ENgrid. Learn how to capture custom events, define variables, and optimize your user data collection for more informed decisions and strategies.
---

4Site's ENgrid automatically takes all of the available data from your Engaging Networks pages and pushes it to Google Tag Manager's as GTM Custom Events and GTM Custom Variables. In order to take advantage of this data and use it in your reporting in Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta, and more, you'll need to create a set of variables, triggers, and tags in your Google Tag Manager (GTM) container that will capture the data when a user lands on and interacts with your page.

When your Engaging Networks page loads on a user's screen, it pushes the entire Engaging Networks `pageJson` into the DataLayer as GTM Custom Events and GTM Custom Variables. This allows you to see details like donation amount, donation frequency, currency, and more in GTM, GA4, Meta, and other analytics platforms you might use.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Automatic Data Pushing**: ENgrid automatically pushes all available data from Engaging Networks pages to the Data Layer
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Capture donation amounts, supporter ID's, transaction IDs, and more
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Use data in Google Analytics, Google Ads, Meta, and other analytics platforms

This guide walks you through all of the variables, triggers, and tags you'll need to set up in GTM if you're using ENgrid.

---

# Prerequisites

Before setting up GTM with ENgrid, ensure you have:

1. **ENgrid Enabled**: Your Engaging Networks pages must be using ENgrid
2. **Transaction Details Exposed**: In your Engaging Networks Account Settings > Account Preferences, check the box to "Expose transaction details" to enable the `pageJson` object
3. **GTM Container**: Access to your Google Tag Manager container
4. **Meta Pixel ID** (if using Meta ads): Your Facebook/Meta Pixel ID for conversion tracking
5. **GA4 Configuration** (if using Google Analytics): Your GA4 Measurement ID

# Google Tag Manager Setup for EN Variables, Triggers & Tags

## Naming Conventions Best Practices:

In your Google Tag Manager account:

- Ensure all **variables** you create start with `"EN"`
- Ensure all **triggers** you create start with `"EN"`
- Ensure the **tags** you will set up are descriptive of their functions, so something like:
  1. Meta Pixel (if you're using Meta ads in your marketing)
  2. Meta \- Conversion \- EN Successful Donation
  3. GA4 \- Conversion \- EN Successful Donation

---

## Step 1: Add EN Variables

In GTM, **variables** are used to pull dynamic values from your site—like donation amounts, supporter ID's, and transaction IDs.

**Important Notes:**

- All of the variables listed below are **already being pushed into the Data Layer** as part of various events (like successful donations, recurring page loads, and errors)
- You do **not** need to write custom JavaScript to define them—they're there, and we're just telling GTM how to listen for them
- You will create "Data Layer Variable" types, setting the Data Layer Variable Name exactly as provided

### To add each EN variable:

1. In your GTM container, go to **Variables** from the left-hand menu.
2. Scroll down to **User-Defined Variables**, and click **New**.
3. Choose **"Data Layer Variable"** as the type.
4. Set the **Data Layer Variable Name** exactly as shown in the table below.
5. Save.

Here are the variables you need to create:

| GTM Variable Name                        | Data Layer Variable Name      |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Transaction ID        | `EN_PAGEJSON_TRANSACTIONID`   |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Supporter ID          | `EN_PAGEJSON_SUPPORTERID`     |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Recurring Frequency   | `EN_RECURRING_FREQUENCIES`    |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Recurring             | `EN_PAGEJSON_RECURRING`       |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Receipt Number        | `EN_PAGEJSON_RECEIPTNUMBER`   |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Payment Type          | `EN_PAGEJSON_PAYMENTTYPE`     |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Type             | `EN_PAGEJSON_PAGETYPE`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Redirect Present | `EN_PAGEJSON_REDIRECTPRESENT` |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Number           | `EN_PAGEJSON_PAGENUMBER`      |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Name             | `EN_PAGEJSON_PAGENAME`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Count            | `EN_PAGEJSON_PAGECOUNT`       |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Locale                | `EN_PAGEJSON_LOCALE`          |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Gift Process          | `EN_PAGEJSON_GIFTPROCESS`     |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Fee Cover Amount      | `EN_PAGEJSON_FEECOVER`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Donation Frequency    | `EN_PAGEJSON_TRANSACTIONTYPE` |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Donation Currency     | `EN_PAGEJSON_CURRENCY`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Donation Amount       | `EN_PAGEJSON_AMOUNT`          |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Country               | `EN_PAGEJSON_COUNTRY`         |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Client ID             | `EN_PAGEJSON_CLIENTID`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Campaign Page ID      | `EN_PAGEJSON_CAMPAIGNPAGEID`  |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Campaign ID           | `EN_PAGEJSON_CAMPAIGNID`      |

---

## Step 2: Add EN Triggers

Triggers tell GTM _when_ to run a tag—like right after a successful donation or when a form loads.

These are **Custom Event Triggers**, meaning they fire based on named events your EN page is already sending to the GTM Data Layer.

---

### To create each EN trigger:

1. Click **"Triggers"** in the left menu.
2. Click **"New"**, and give it the name listed below.
3. Select **Trigger Type: Custom Event**.
4. Enter the **Event Name** exactly as shown.
5. Leave "This trigger fires on" set to **All Custom Events**.
6. Save.

Here are the EN triggers to add:

| Trigger Name              | Event Name                     |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| EN Successful Donation    | `EN_SUCCESSFUL_DONATION`       |
| EN_SUBMISSION_SUCCESS\_\* | `^EN_SUBMISSION_SUCCESS_(.+)$` |

Each of these events also sends the EN variables listed above into the Data Layer—so the triggers and variables work hand in hand depeding on your need.

---

## Step 3: Add These Tags

Let's connect everything together using **tags** that fire when someone completes a donation (and beyond, in the case of the Meta Pixel).

---

### 1\. Meta Pixel

This tag fires on every page to track page activity within your Meta Events Manager.

#### Instructions:

1. Go to **Tags** \> **New**
2. Name it: `Meta Pixel` (or something similar if you already had an old Meta Pixel tag prior to moving onto ENgrid)
3. Choose **Tag Type "Facebook Pixel" from the Gallery of built-in tags**.
4. Paste in your Meta Pixel base code (tip: create a variable with your Meta Pixel ID and enter it into this tag as a variable. That way, if your Pixel ID ever changes, you can update it on the variable and not have to do so across all your tags in GTM). Screenshot: [https://cln.sh/FPdS6SnV](https://cln.sh/FPdS6SnV)
5. Under "Advanced Settings" \> "Tag firing options," select "Once per event."
6. Add the **Trigger**: `All Pages`
7. Save

---

### 2\. Facebook \- Conversion \- EN Successful Donation

This tag tells Facebook when someone completes a donation.

#### Instructions:

1. Go to **Tags** \> **New**
2. Name it: `Facebook - Conversion - EN Successful Donation` (or something similar if you already had an old Meta Pixel tag prior to moving onto ENgrid)
3. Choose **Tag Type "Facebook Pixel" from the Gallery of built-in tags**.
4. Paste in your Meta Pixel base code (tip: create a variable with your Meta Pixel ID and enter it into this tag as a variable. That way, if your Pixel ID ever changes, you can update it on the variable and not have to do so across all your tags in GTM).
5. Make sure object properties "value" and "currency" are added (screenshot: [https://cln.sh/660bJHLP](https://cln.sh/660bJHLP))
6. Make sure this tag is associated with the firing trigger "EN Successful Donation" as in the screenshot above.

---

### 3\. GA4 \- Conversion \- EN Successful Donation

This tag sends a conversion event to Google Analytics 4 whenever a donation is successful.

#### Instructions:

1. Go to **Tags** \> **New**
2. Name it: `GA4 - Conversion - EN Successful Donation` (or something similar within your naming conventions).
3. Choose **Tag Type**: `GA4 Event`
4. Select your **GA4 Configuration Tag** (or enter the Measurement ID manually, ideally as its own variable so it's easier to swap out if it changes down the line).
5. Set **Event Name** to: `purchase`
6. Under **Event Parameters**, create a new variable called `"EN Donation - GA4 Event Parameters"` (or something similar in your naming convention).
7. Add the following event parameters by clicking the lego icon and selecting the variables you just created. Full list below for reference:

| Parameter Name                                                                      | Value                                         |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Locale                                                           | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Locale}}`                |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Name                                                        | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Page Name}}`             |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Number                                                      | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Page Number}}`           |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Redirect Present                                            | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Page Redirect Present}}` |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Page Type                                                        | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Page Type}}`             |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Payment Type                                                     | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Payment Type}}`          |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Receipt Number                                                   | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Receipt Number}}`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Recurring Donation Made                                          | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Recurring}}`             |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Recurring Frequency                                              | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Recurring Frequency}}`   |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Transaction ID                                                   | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Transaction ID}}`        |
| ENgrid pageJson \- Supporter ID _(note: this can be listed under "User properties)_ | `{{ENgrid pageJson - Supporter ID}}`          |

8. For the **Trigger**, choose: `EN Successful Donation`

9. Click **Save**

Tip: The variables listed above are already being pushed to the data layer when the `EN_SUCCESSFUL_DONATION` event fires, so this tag will automatically pull the correct values at the right time.

---

# Testing and Validation

After setting up your GTM configuration:

1. **Preview Mode**: Use GTM's Preview mode to test your setup
2. **Data Layer Inspection**: Check the browser console to see events being pushed
3. **Real-Time Reports**: Verify data appears in GA4 and Meta Events Manager
4. **Test Transactions**: Complete test donations to ensure conversion tracking works

---

# Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **Variables not populating**: Ensure the Data Layer Variable Names match exactly
- **Events not firing**: Check that triggers are set to "All Custom Events" (when applicable)
- **Missing data**: Verify "Expose transaction details" is enabled in Engaging Networks
- **GTM not loading**: Ensure GTM is properly installed on your pages and you're not running an Ad Blocker

# Field Exclusion and Hashing

Some fields are excluded from the DataLayer for privacy/security reasons:

**Excluded fields:**

- Credit Card: `transaction.ccnumber`, `transaction.ccexpire.delimiter`, `transaction.ccexpire`, `transaction.ccvv`, `supporter.creditCardHolderName`
- Bank: `supporter.bankAccountNumber`, `supporter.bankAccountType`, `transaction.bankname`, `supporter.bankRoutingNumber`

**Hashed fields:** (values are base64-encoded before being pushed)

- Supporter contact/address: `supporter.emailAddress`, `supporter.phoneNumber`, `supporter.phoneNumber2`, `supporter.address1`, `supporter.address2`, `supporter.address3`
- In Honor/Memory: `transaction.infemail`, `transaction.infadd1`, `transaction.infadd2`, `transaction.infadd3`
- Billing address: `supporter.billingAddress1`, `supporter.billingAddress2`, `supporter.billingAddress3`

---

# Event Value Transformations

- String values are transformed to uppercase, spaces replaced with dashes, and `:-` replaced with `-`.
- Boolean values are transformed to `"TRUE"` or `"FALSE"`.

---

# Premium Gift Handling

When the field name is `en__pg` (premium gift), the `EN_FORM_VALUE_UPDATED` event includes:

- `enFieldName`
- `enFieldLabel` (always "Premium Gift")
- `enFieldValue` (gift name)
- `enProductId` (from `transaction.selprodvariantid`)

---

# End of Gift Process Events (Advanced)

ENgrid stores certain events in sessionStorage at the end of the gift process and replays them on the next page load. This is an advanced feature for tracking multi-step flows and ensuring all events are captured.

---

# Comprehensive Examples

## Example: pageJson on a Petition Page

Page 1 (before submission):

```js
var pageJson = {
  clientId: 94,
