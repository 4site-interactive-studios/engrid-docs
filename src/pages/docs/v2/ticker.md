The Ticker component provides an animated scrolling text display, commonly used for showing recent donation activity or promotional messages.

## How It Works

The Ticker component looks for elements with the `engrid-ticker` class and animates their content in a scrolling/ticker-tape style display.

## Styling

The ticker is styled via `_engrid-ticker.scss`. You can customize the animation speed, direction, and appearance in your client theme.
