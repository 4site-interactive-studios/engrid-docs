## Practical Time!

Let's run through the whole process of making and testing a change to your ENgrid theme.

* Make a feature branch
* Develop the change locally, push it to Github.
* Test it on the Feature branch using URL parameters
  * [Previewing your changes](/docs/v2/developing-with-engrid#previewing-your-changes)
* Test it on the Feature branch using a code block
  * [Feature Branch Documentation](/docs/v2/developing-with-engrid#advanced-development-techniques-with-e-ngrid-for-engaging-networks)
* Merge into live and deploy
  * Recording: [https://cln.sh/ZS0zJJdc](https://cln.sh/ZS0zJJdc)
  * Pages > Component Library > Images and Files (in sidebar) > Î©1. 4Site Live - ENgrid Templates
    * engrid.min.js
    * engrid.min.css

## Upstream ENgrid Scripts Changes

* Clone the ENgrid Scripts repository [https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid/](https://github.com/4site-interactive-studios/engrid/) and make a new branch.
* Update your "/src/index.ts" and and "/src/sass/main.scss" to point to the local assets instead of the NPM assets.
* Run "npm run watch" in your engrid-scripts directory, and "npm run start" in your theme directory.
* Make any necessary changes
* Push your code to Github and open a Pull Request, tagging Fernando as a reviewer.
