## Gift Frequency Helper Classes

Makes the Gift Frequency Radio Inputs look like Buttons. Also works as a page level class.

```
radio-to-buttons_recurrpay
```

When the Radio to Buttons class is added you can change the number of buttons by including a second helper class or by defining your own values in CSS.

| Class                         | Description             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `recurring-frequency_count_1` | Shows 1 button per row  |
| `recurring-frequency_count_2` | Shows 2 buttons per row |
| `recurring-frequency_count_3` | Shows 3 buttons per row |
| `recurring-frequency_count_4` | Shows 4 buttons per row |
| `recurring-frequency_count_5` | Shows 5 buttons per row |
