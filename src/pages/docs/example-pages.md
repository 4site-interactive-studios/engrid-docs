## Naming Patterns

* Page Column `pc` or `page-` - The full width of the page.
* Content Column `cc` or `content-` - The maximum width in which content is displayed, excluding edge to edge content (e.g Background Image).
* Body Column `bc` or `body-` - Sits inside the content column, but can be positioned horizontally anywhere.
