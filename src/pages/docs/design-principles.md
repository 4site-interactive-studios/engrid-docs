{% accordion %}
  {% accordion-item title="Section 1 Title" %}
    Content for Section 1 goes here.

    Content for Section 2 goes here.

    Content for Section 3 goes here.
  {% /accordion-item %}
{% /accordion %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

{% callout title="You should know!" %}

## Global Variables

### EngridAmounts 

With that variable you can set dynamic amounts at the page level.

Example:

```
window.EngridAmounts = {
  "onetime": {
    amounts: {
      "10": 10,
      "30": 30,
      "50": 50,
      "100": 100,
      "Other": "other",
    },
    default: 30,
  },
  "monthly": {
    amounts: {
      "5": 5,
      "15": 15,
      "25": 25,
      "30": 30,
      "Other": "other",
    },
    default: 15,
  },
};
```

When you're using the `window.EngridAmounts` option, the user-selected amount will persist when changing frequencies if:

1. We're coming from a backend error.
2. We have an amount defined via URL.
3. The user selected a non-default amount.

**Known Limitations**

1. This option does not work with NSG or other similar native EN features
2. You need to remove any Swap List from the donation amount field. If you don't there will be race conditions between the swap list and our code which will create unpredictable and inconsistent behaviors.

"Smartypants, double quotes" and 'single quotes'


## Emphasis

**This is bold text**

__This is bold text__

*This is italic text*

_This is italic text_

~~Strikethrough~~


## Blockquotes


> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.


## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

## Tables
