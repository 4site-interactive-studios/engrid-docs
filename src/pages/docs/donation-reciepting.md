There are seven types of receipts you can create. but OC only makes use of

* **Original Receipt** - For when someone makes a gift. [More information here](https://www.engagingnetworks.support/knowledge-base/fundraising-receipt/)
* **Replacement Receipt** - A replacement of an Original Receipt. [More information here](https://www.engagingnetworks.support/knowledge-base/gadgets-single-donations/) under the “Issuing a replacement receipt” heading.
* **Split Receipt** - When only one portion of the donation is eligible for a receipt. [More information here](https://www.engagingnetworks.support/knowledge-base/split-receipt/).
* **Annual Receipt** - Generating a list of transactions over a date range. These receipts can only be generated using the “Year End Receipting” batch process.  [More information here](http://www.engagingnetworks.support/knowledge-base/annual-receipting/).

## Attaching a receipt link in a Thank You email 

Go to **Pages > Manage Pages** and edit the campaign (donation) page you want to add the receipt to. On the right-hand toolbar, click on Auto-responders and then Thank you email. If you haven't created a thank you email yet, you can create a new thank you email now. You can select the receipt from the dropdown. You can insert a link to this receipt in the email body with the WYSIWYG editor. Receipts sent in this way can be resent.

### Adding custom receipts scenarios (e.g. Recurring, Amount, Country, etc..) 

While in the **"Thank you email"** auto-responder pop-up click the green **"+"** tab to add custom receipting scenarios.

## Receipts with Premiums (Split Receipts) 

For receipts that take into account tax differences for donations that get premiums, use split receipts.


### Premium Scenario 
If a gift of $50 is made, and a $15 tshirt premium is received. The following values can be used:

* Donation: $50
* Value Advantage: $15
* Eligible Gift Amount: $35

We can present these values in any way we desire. For example:

Donation: $50 \
Tax Deductible Contribution: $35 

    Your Tax Deductible Contribution is calculated as your donation less any premium gift received.

* Premium Gifts Received: $15

## Re-sending a "Regular" receipt

Go to **Data & Reports > Look up Supporter** and search for your supporter in question. View their profile. From the “Single Donation” gadget you can reissue a copy of an original receipt, issue a replacement receipt, refund a donation, or change the tax status.

Click to expand the transaction and select **“Replacement Receipt”**. From the expanded area that appears choose the template for the Receipt from the “Replacement receipt:” dropdown. Then enter a sender email. Then you can ignore or choose a **“Select Template:”** option which just helps pre-populate email copy that prefecases the attached receipt. \

### Recurring Gift Recepting 

Note an option. According to EN support 
>We don't issue receipts for recurring donations because they are one part gift of a whole.


## Resending a "Premium Gift" receipt 

Same as a regular receipt but now you can resend the **"Original receipt"** along with a **"Replacement receipt"**

### Replacement Receipt vs Original Receipt 

A **“Replacement Receipt”** is similar to an original receipt but will create a new receipt ID when generated.


## Sending Annual Receipts 

Annual Receipting is done manually and in **"Batches"**. Following the instructions listed on the documentation: [https://support.engagingnetworks.net/annual-receipting](https://support.engagingnetworks.net/annual-receipting)

**NOTE: There is no way to "Test" annual receipting**


## Receipt for notification email 

**Account settings > Account Preferences > Attach receipt** for notification email (checkbox).

If this checkbox is ticked, we will also attach a copy of the receipt to your internal notification email for each successful transaction.


## To Be Documented v
