This is documentation about managing the ask string swap list in Engaging Networks and is not specific to ENgrid, but it comes up often enough that we have a step-by-step guide. Here is how to update One-time or Monthly giving amounts on a page that uses a Form Component with a Swap List.

| Step | Instruction | Screenshot |
|------|-------------|------------|
| 1    | Edit the Form Component with the “Donation Amount” field. | [screenshot](https://cln.sh/xQVrHW62) |

| 11   | **IMPORTANT**: Understand how the default amount for the One-time Swap List works. | [recording](https://cln.sh/HrqSd22t) |
